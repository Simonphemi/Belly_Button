# Belly_Button Analysis
About Interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity data-set, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Purpose/Background
In this assignment, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. Our dashboard includes an input element where the user can specify the subject ID number and the details of the subject are presented on the dashboard. Along with the test subject details, the dashboard presents three specific charts:

A bar chart which shows the top 10 bacteria types with OTU IDs on the y axis and the sample value on the x axis.
A bubble chart which shows the distribution of all bacteria (OTU ID) amd their sample value.
A gauge chart which shows the washing frequency of the subject's navel.
